Description:
  Soil drainage is a relatively simple classification of the soil profile that
  describes the likelihood of seasonal wetness (Webb & Lilburne 2011). It is based
  on the occurrence within specific depths of redox segregation and low chroma
  colours indicative of waterlogging and reduction (Milne et al. 1995). This layer
  is a "dissolved" representation of the soil drainage attribute for S-map soils,
  where neighbouring S-map polygons have been combined if they have the same value
  of the attribute. Please refer to document Smap Data Dictionary Dissolved
