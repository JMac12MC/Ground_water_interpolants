🔵 Why rasterizing works better for smooth heatmaps:
Your current mesh: shows jagged triangle edges (clearly visible in the image — angular steps and banding).

Raster grid: samples values at regular pixel centers (e.g. 512×512 or 1024×1024 grid), then uses interpolation (bilinear or cubic) to make smooth transitions.

Rendered with GPU shaders or raster tiles, this gives a continuous “liquid-like” look — just like Windy.com.


🔧 What to do (in short):
Interpolate your triangle mesh into a regular grid (griddata, pykrige, RBF, etc.).

Save it as a raster (GeoTIFF or PNG).

Generate raster tiles using gdal2tiles.py or rio cogeo.

Use deck.gl TileLayer + BitmapLayer, or MapLibre GL JS to load tiles.

Apply bilinear or bicubic interpolation when rendering to make it smooth.
