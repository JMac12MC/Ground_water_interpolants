Description:
  New Zealand Environmental Data Stack (NZEnvDS) comprises a set of 72 spatial
  layers for environmental modelling and site characterisation. NZEnvDS includes
  the layers that informed the Land Environments of New Zealand (LENZ), additional
  layers generated for LENZ that were never publicly released, and additional
  layers generated since, all covering mainland New Zealand and surrounding
  inshore islands. The original/top copy of the dataset is available at
  (https://doi.org/10.7931/m6rm-vz40), but the layers are reproduced here for ease
  of access. See (https://newzealandecology.org/nzje/3440/) for a publication
  describing NZEnvDS.
  
  Horizontal distance calculated using the NZ River Centrelines
  
  (Topo, 1:500 k) spatial layer (Land Information New Zealand 2020a) and
  
  the distance function in the Raster R package (Hijmans 2017).
